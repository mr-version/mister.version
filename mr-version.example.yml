# Mr. Version Configuration Example
# This file demonstrates how to configure version behavior for your monorepo

# Base global version used as fallback when no tags or versions are found
# Applies to all projects including test projects and artifacts normally ignored
baseVersion: "8.2.0"

# Global settings that apply to all projects
prereleaseType: none  # Options: none, alpha, beta, rc
tagPrefix: v         # Prefix for version tags (default: v)
skipTestProjects: true
skipNonPackableProjects: true

# Project-specific overrides
projects:
  # Example: Force a specific project to use alpha prereleases
  MyLibrary:
    prereleaseType: alpha
  
  # Example: Pin a specific project to a fixed version
  LegacyProject:
    forceVersion: 1.0.0
